A reimagined home page for a popular investing/financial services website

I've never liked the old UI/UX interface for their website, I think it is antiquated and hard to get a grasp on everything they have going on on the screen.
I started with a "mobile-first" approach, meaning I designed at a smaller screen size and then added media queries to change the layout as the screen expanded.

## June 11, 2022 UPDATE

- Added responsiveness to the page so the UI adapts as the screen changes.
