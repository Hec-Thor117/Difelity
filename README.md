# Difelity
A reimagined home page for a popular investing/financial services website

I've never liked the old UI/UX interface for their website, I think it is antiquated and hard to get a grasp on everything they have going on on the screen.

So, I wanted to try redesigning it for a more modern feel. It's still a work in progress, but I'm proud of the work I have so far.
